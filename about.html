    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>For the longest time, I've been in love with learning and mastering new things. In the summers, I filled this need through <strong><a href="#achievements" class="no-symbol">Boy Scouts</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#achievements" class="no-symbol">Tae Kwon Do</a></strong> in past summers, and reading and technology during schooltime. Nowadays, I spend my time doing lots of coding and lifting weights.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Eagle Scout - 12 additional palms</h2>
    <p>I earned the highest rank in Scouting as a 16-year old and earned 60 merit badges more than was necessary! It required years and years of dedication, but the journey provided me with countless life experiences and has led to me being a much more well-rounded person.</p>
    <h2>Black Belt - Tae Kwon Do</h2>
    <p>After several years devoted to learning this martial art, I earned my Black Belt! My favorite part was competing in tournaments, especially sparring. I still carry from this journey a focus on discipline, self-control and humility.</p>
    <h2>Small Schools Champion - Scholastic Bowl</h2>
    <p>I didn't do this on my own- as a part of the Wilton Scholastic Bowl team, we competed against other schools in this academic challenge. In a vein similar to "Jeopardy!" we scored points by answering general knowledge, math, history, language arts and science questions faster and more accurately than the other teams.</p>
